# MGZON/Veltrix

This model is a fine-tuned version of [MGZON/Veltrix](https://huggingface.co/MGZON/Veltrix) on the None dataset.
It achieves the following results on the evaluation set:
- Loss: nan

## Features
- **Text Queries**: Ask anything and get detailed responses.
- **Audio Input/Output**: Record audio directly or convert text to speech.
- **Image Analysis**: Capture images from webcam or upload for analysis.
- **Web Search**: Enable DeepSearch for real-time web context.
- **API Support**: Use endpoints like `/api/chat`, `/api/audio-transcription`, `/api/text-to-speech`, `/api/image-analysis`.

## Setup
1. Add `HF_TOKEN` and `BACKUP_HF_TOKEN` as Secrets in Space settings.
2. Add `GOOGLE_API_KEY` and `GOOGLE_CSE_ID` for web search (optional).
3. Set `PORT=7860`, `QUEUE_SIZE=80`, `CONCURRENCY_LIMIT=20` as Variables.
4. Ensure `requirements.txt` and `Dockerfile` are configured correctly.

## Usage
Access the app at `/gradio` or use API endpoints. Examples:
- **Text**: "Explain AI history."
- **Audio**: Record audio for transcription.
- **Image**: Capture or upload an image for analysis.
